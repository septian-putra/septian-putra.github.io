I am a machine learning engineer for at [Exact](https://www.exact.com/), a tech company focused on bookeeping software for SME and Accountant in the Netherland and Belgium.

I am an certified AWS Solution Architect and really interested in working in Machine Learning Project in cloud environment.

I am currently living in the Rotterdam, but originally from a very beautiful city of Yogyakarta, Indonesia. 
I have so much passion in Machine Learning, Electronics, Football and Astronomy.
In fact, I won Gold Medal in National Astronomy Competition and represent my country in 2009 International Astronomy Olympiad.
In my spare time, I like to play FIFA, experiment with food and also visit some parks or Museums. 

This website is mainly to remind myself about something that I already thought, did or learned related to Data Science, Machine Learning or Cloud Environment.
Hopefully, they will be usefull for any of you that somehow found this website.
