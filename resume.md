Usage notes:
* The &lt;ul&gt; element is for grouping a collection of items that do not have a numerical ordering, and their order in the list is meaningless. Typically, unordered-list items are displayed with a bullet, which can be of several forms, like a dot, a circle or a squared.
* There is no limitation to the depth and alternation of nested lists defined with the &lt;ol&gt; and &lt;ul&gt; elements.
* The &lt;ol&gt; and &lt;ul&gt; elements both represent a list of items. They differ in that, with the &lt;ol&gt; element, the order is meaningful.
